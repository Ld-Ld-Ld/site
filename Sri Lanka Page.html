  <div style="flex-grow: 8">
  	<p>The capital city combines modern urban amenities with the country's colorful indigenous and colonial history. </p>
  	<p>The city is also filled with museums and other things to do that can help connect you with Sri Lankan culture. Colombo sits on the coast, and there's a large green space and beach area right in the heart of the city separating an area called Fort from the Indian Ocean. It's the city's public playground and a fun place to visit, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
  	<p>The city's new mega-tower, the Colombo Lotus Tower, is a great place to visit. The tallest free-standing tower in Southeast Asia, it provides amazing views of the city.</p>

  <div style="flex-grow: 8">
  	<p>Kandy, the second largest city in Sri Lanka.  </p>
  	<p>Kandy is where you go to learn about and experience Sri Lankan history. Located in central Sri Lanka, the city is the former capital city of the Sri Lankan royal dynasty, the country's main capital before the colonial period. The high point of what's called the "Kandian Era" was between the 15th and 18th centuries, when the area remained independent while most of the coastal regions were colonized by European powers.</p>
  	<p>Be sure to visit the city's National Museum of Kandy, as it illustrates the story of the region and its people via exhibits and artifacts. Nearby, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a very holy Buddhist shrine, part of the royal palace complex.</p>

  	<img class="galle" src="galle.jpg" alt="Galle"4 width="259" height="209"></div>
  <div style="flex-grow: 8">
  	<p>The city of Galle is about a two-hour drive from Colombo via one of the country's first modern superhighways. This ancient trading port reflects its colonial history and is focused around a large, 17th-century seafront fort. </p>
  	<p>Galle Fort is an entire preserved walled town, now filled with boutique hotels, shops, and restaurants (along with real residents). The entire area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
  	<p>This is a great place to explore on foot – the entire Fort area is car-free. It's hard to get lost, as you're surrounded on three sides by the sea.</p>
  	<p>Aside from and outside the fort, the city is surrounded by some amazing beaches.</p>

  <div style="flex-grow: 8">
  	<p>The beach is large, so it never feels too crowded. There are a lot of beachfront stands selling all kinds of delicious local street food and a good number of small hotels and guesthouses if you want to stay overnight. </p>
  	<p>It's also known for its coral. The Hikkaduwa Coral Sanctuary is a preserved marine area and part of Hikkaduwa National Park, located just off the shoreline. It was created to protect the area's coral reefs and educate visitors about coral.</p>
  	<p>Hikkaduwa is one of the best surfing spots in Sri Lanka, offering a clear hot water base. The waves vary in size from 4 to 11 feet. Surfing in the Hikkaduwa area is fairly well known and gets the best surfing during its dry season, which is from November to March.</p>

  <div style="flex-grow: 8">
  	<p>Wannabe archaeologists need to put Sigiriya on their list of must-see places to visit in Sri Lanka. This ancient city is built on a steep slope, topped by a plateau almost 180 meters (600 feet) high.</p>
  	<p>This plateau is known as Lion’s Rock as it oversees the jungles below. Access to the site is through staircases and rooms emanating from the lion’s mouth. You’ll also see ponds, gardens and fountains. Pretty cool!</p>
  	<p>Locals consider the site the eighth wonder of the world. This ancient rock fortress dates back to the third century BC when it was a monastery. It was later turned into a royal residence.</p>
